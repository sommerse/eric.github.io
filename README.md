Hi, my name is Eric and I have been an IT professional for over 20 years, working in such fields as VB developer, Data Analyst, Project Manager and Business Analyst.  My current aspiration is to make the leap from a once-upon-a-time developer to a web developer, and am beginning course and training to that end.    I am a strong believer in encouraging and wishing well of others, and will never abandon my values to claim "another rung" on the ladder.  Anyway, that's a bit about me.  Thanks for reading!
