Hi, my name is Eric and I have been an IT professional for over 20 years, working in such roles as VB developer, Data Analyst, Project Manager and Business Analyst.  My current aspiration is to make the leap from a once-upon-a-time VB developer to a web developer, and am beginning courses and training to that end.    I am a strong believer in the encouragement and "building up" of others, and will never abandon my values to claim "another rung" on the ladder.  Anyway, that's a bit about me.  Thanks for reading!
